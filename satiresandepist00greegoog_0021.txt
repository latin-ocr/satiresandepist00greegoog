by another, caused by the general familiarity with the poet, has
made it next to impossible to establish any families‚ or any pre·
oedence of any one over others, or even of any dozen over tbe
rest So that what we have of Horace is a text very much
altered by the tinkering of scholars according to their knowl-
edge and whims, but at the same time checked ofi by reference
to the constant stream of tradition. This process has appar-
ently been going on from the poet's own time. So that very
little cau be done now in the way of improvement of the text,
unless some manuscript should corne to light thathas lain un·
used for more than a thousand years. For a description of the

manuscripts, the studentis referred to Orelli and (less fully)
Keller and Holder.

'ihe Satires and the poems generally seem to have be'en first
written for private reading and circulatim, somewhat as single
poema appear nowadays in ephemera] literature and are later
collected into volumes, and not to have been properly published

Ι until some time after their composition. Exactly at what time
¹this was done in the case of the Satires is unknown, but we may
well suppose that the first book was published before ne. 33,
in which year Horace received from Maecenas the gist of hia
Sabine farm, a gift which can hardly be looked upon otherwise
than as a return for the compiiment of the dedication to Μω-
cenas in 1. 1. There is no clear indication that the two books
of Satires were published separately, yet there is a slight differ·
enee of style between the two, and the scene with ‘Ihebatius in
ΙΙ. 1. seems to indicate a new undertaking, a conclusionwhich
is also strengthened by the completeness of the first book and
the evident incompleteness of the second.

The form of composition Horace himself calls Sermones, to
distinguish it from the higher fiights of poetry which he attempta
in iiis lyrics. But the name Satura must also have been given
to the work at the time (as in II. 1. r), and has always been
the prevailing title.
