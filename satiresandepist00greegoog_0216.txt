Quodsi bruma nives Albanis illinet agris,

ad marc descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet
contractusque leget; te, dulcis amice, reviset

cum Zephyris, si concedes, et hirundine prima.

Non quo more piris vesci Calaber iubet hospes,

tu me fecisti locupletem. ‘Vescere sodes i’ 15
'Iam satis est’· ‘At tu quantum vis tolle' ‘Benigne’
‘Non invisa feres pueris munuscula parvis?

‘Tam teneor dono quam si dimittar onustus.'

.‘ Vt libet ; haec porcis hodie comedenda relinques!
Prodigus et stultus donat quae spernit et odit; ω
haec seges ingratos tulit et feret omnibus annis.

Vir bonus et sapiens dignis ait esse paratus ;

rr. descendet: merely of the giver. The anecdota of the Cala·
descent from the hills to some south· brian host (no doubt a story current
ern resort (cf. v. 45).-sihl par· at the time, and localized us such
apt, takde care qshimsels by avoiding stories usually are) gives nn instance
tecol.

12. contractus, fn a cosy corner,

oi thoughtless giving merely of that
which is superfluouswithout thought

referring merely to the poet’s “ cud-
dling himself up ” to keep warm. Cf.
Gravissima frigore solus atque con·
tractati Dormitanta'us vigilabit in
lecto. St. Jerome, in Vig. § 15.

lnque manus venit tritus de more libellus,

Nmffiuid nugarum contractusque lege·

Nam rore Auctumni matutinisque pruinis
Erigidprlgsintrabat male cartas aura fen·

Q. Sacram (h. Sergardi, an. 1⁶50),
Satyrae, 4. 6.

13. Zephyris: cf. Lucr. V. 738.
¹4 non quo more, etc: the
transition is abrupt, but is founded
,οη the relations of the parties.
Maecenas had been such a munifi·
cent patron to Horace that he might
seem to have a right to the society
of his friend under any and all cir·
cumstances. But Horace puts their
friendship upon a basis which ex·
eludes ingratitude in the receiver aa
nell as selfish arrogance in the

of the character or merit of the
receives, and without any personal
regard. Such has not been Mae·
cenas’ generosity to the poet.

16. tolle: ale. take away with
you—benigne, no, thank you, like
merci in French.

¹9· haec porcis,etc.= represent·
ing the worthlessness of the gift to
the host himself.

20. prodigus et stultuar ie. it
is the prodigal and fool who, etc.-
spernit et odit: i.e. cares nothing
for, and in fact wants to be rid of.

21. ingratos, etc.= for naturally
where there is no personal regard
nor sacrifice, no gratitude is likely
tobefelt.

22. dignis: a'.e. the wise man
makes a distinction in the objects
of his bounty, so that the gift is a
mark of esteem, and is prized as
such. - ait esse: a familiar Greek
construction horrowed hythe Latin
poets for brevity.
