[Lrs. 1

obiciet nemo sordes mihi quas tibi, Tilli,

cum Tiburte via praetorem quinque sequuntur
te pueri, lasanum portantes oenophorumque.
Hoc ego commodius quam tu, praeclare senator,
milibus atque aliis vivo. Quacumque libido est,
incedo solus ; percontor quanti holus ac far ;
fallacem circum vespertinumque pererro

saepe forum ; adsisto divinis; inde domum me
ad porri et ciceris refero laganique catinum.
Cena ministratur pueris tribus, et lapis albus
pocula curn cyatho duo sustinet; adstat echinus

where one would expect him to

receiving hospitality which he would

wine-basiet, carried in tke same

113. fallacem circum: the re·
gion of the Circus Maximus (the
valley where was the early commer-
cial forum) seems to have been the
resort of all kinds of loose charac-
ters. Shops occupied the outer walls
of the substructione of the building.
Horace doubtless refers to sharpers,
confidence men, and the like, who

parts of a city.
