therefore many things in the notes which the advanced latin
scholar may pass over. But the editor has derived so much
advanuge from editions of the Classics in which the notes
reminded him in particular connectious of things which iu
general he knew before, that -he has not inquired so much
whether a thing was likely to be known, as whether it was
likely to be thought of in the connection. The notes are
intended notro much to aid the student in the study of the
latin lnngrrage as in the study of Horace-what he meant,
how he felt, and what prompted him to write as he did. In
accordance with the plan of the “College Series,” the notes

are put ut the bottom of the page to facilitate reference. The
¹ editor is persuaded that college studente sufficiently advanced
to undertake Horace, ought no longer to get and recite lessons,
but to study the literature, and understand and enjoy it. If
the editor's suggestions enable any'body to do this, his purpose

will have been accomplished.
