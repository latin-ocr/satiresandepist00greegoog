This kind of literature, which is almost entirely, if not
entirely, Roman (Satura quidem aa nostra est, Quint. ¹X.
1. 93), had not originally the same meaning that satire has κ
at present Its real meaning is “miscellam''¹ (ci. lanx sa·
tura, lex santra), and it was first used, so iar as we know,
by Ennius (ac. 239-169) to' describe a collection of verse
with-mixed metres as well as mixed subjects. This mean-

ing was also followed by Pacuvius, his nephew, and later by
M. Terentius Varro, the great antiquarian, a contemporary of
Cicero. lucibus, in the tirne oi Africanus the Younger, used

the word to denote a series oi pictures os lite and manners in ,

verse (generally hexameter), more nearly, though not entirely,
in the style which we now call satirical. His satires, oi which
we have fragments, consist oi soenes aud character sketches
from life, and are generally, though not always, airned at the
iollyandwickedne‘ss oi mankind, particularly as found in the
party opposed to the clique oi Scipio and his friends. The exact
connection oi Lucilius' efforts with Greek models is not cleas.
In Horace's time there seems to have been no idea that there

· was any immediate connection with anything Greek except a
. remote one with the Old Comedy.. Some oi the writings oi
Ennius may have suggested the development= that Lucilius gave
to satire. There was evidently also among the Romans astrong
tendency towards dramatic composition oi a lighter kind, as is
indicated by the Fescennine and Atellane farces. There was
also a strong tendency to “ convicia,” or persona] abuse in con-
versations] form, “chaffing,” or “Billingsgate.” There were
also extant at that time some compositione in Greek called
Ἅλυι, which seem to have been poetical semidramatic char·
actersketches, something like the prose writings ol Lucian.
These Silloi may have given a suggestion to Ennius and Lucil·
ius 3 and as the comedy which would naturally have sprung
from all these seeds was crowded out by the translation oi
the more advanced Greek dramas‚ the Satire see-ms to have
been the- result ol the comic tendencyoi the Romans turned
