, HORATI EPISTVLAE [Liui.

VII.

Quinque dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum
Sextilem totum mendax desideror. Atqui
si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem,
quam· mihi das aegro, dabis aegrotare timenti,
¹ Maecenas, veniam, dum licus prima calorque ε
dissignatorem decorat lictoribus atris; ·
dum pueris omnis'pater et matercula pallet,
officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis
adducit febris et testamenta resignat.

Emeruit 7. Thougb Horace was
a man of humble extraction and
position, brought hy his genius and
education into companionship with
the great, yet be seems to bave been
entirely free from servility of nature,
and accordingly to have preserved
his independence even in the diffi-
cult relation of client and patron.
For his seli-respect we may com·
pare Sot. 1. 6, and for his views of
the relation of clientship, Ep. I. 18.
'lhis epistle was evidently written
to Maecenas to justify himself for
preferriug considerations of health
to the claims of his patron. Ηο
had apparently retired from the
city to the country (perhaps to
Tibur. Cf. vv. 45 and ιο) for a few
days, aud had continued away for
amouth. and now had itin mind
to remain away tbe whole winter.
While excusing himself ou the ples
of ill health, he also asserts (v.
34 seq.) his liberty of action within
the limita of friendship.

t. quinque: often loosely used
of a short indefinite time—rure:
probably at Tibur.

2. Sextilem: the montb ol Au·
gust was not so named until 8 tac.
-desideror, Ι allow myreis to be
misseol - atqui, arrd yet (though 1
fail to keep my promise).

3. sanum recteque valentem:
without essential differeuce of tuean-
ing, like well and strong, ἐκ good
health and vigor.

4. aegrotare: here equivalent to
the regular construction with ne,
though properly used with adiffer·
ent meaning.

5. dum licus, etc: a poetical
description of the unhealthy season
of autumn.

6. dissignatorem, the under-
taber, who managed lunerals, much
asin modern times-decorat: ol
course the presence of the lictors,
as “assistant marshals,” would in·
dicate a splendid funeral, and so
they are said to be the undertaker's
adornments. -atrlaz clotbed in
black, as in modern times. ‘

7. matercula, flmd mother, the
diminutive of affection, reversed as
it were.

8. officiosa: i.e. in the perform·
ance of duties, especially social
(officia), as the attendance upon
the great and the like. — opella io·
reneis: in reference to the services
of the patronus, which at this reason
would he petty and iusigtrificant.

the winter becomes too eold there.
