Ibam forte via Sacra, sicut meus est moa,

nescio quid meditans nugarum, totus in illis:

accurrit quidam notus mihi nomine tantum,

arreptaque manu, ‘Quid agis, dulcissime rerum i’
‘suaviter, ut nunc est,' inquam, ‘et cupio omnia quae

vis.'

Cum adsectaretur, ‘Numquid vis ?’ occupo. At ille

Samus 9. This Satire, one ot'
the most famous, treats ol the efforts
ol a pushing aspirant to sociat rec-
ognition to attach himself to Hor-
ace from ambitious motives. In a
society so aristocratic, and at the
same time so unstable, as was the
Roman at this period, social ambi-

' tions must bave had a very active

stimulation. Horace¹s own rise in
lile had been extraordinary, aud
merc vulgar aspirants and snobs
could not but attribute it to the
same sellish and pushing arta that
they were in the habit ol using, and
endeavor to unite with him, and
get bis support lor their own ad·
vancemeut.

r. ibam: cl. 6. 112 and 122.-
via sacra: the lloulevards os Rome,
the lavorite loungingplace, along-
side the lorum, and where the most
brilliant out-door lit'e was carried
{ma nugarum: probably some ef·
ort tn verse.

3. accurrit: his manner ol ap-
proach already suggests his effusive-
ness.

4. arrepta: this action is also
excessive; a simple salve would
have been enough-quid agie:
the common very familiar saluta·
tion, like How are you? or How

goes iti-dulcissime, etc, my
dearest sellom: still ruore familiar.
-rerumz partitive genitive(equiv-
alent to “in the world '’), but the
gender ol the adjective is determined
by the sense. The best translation
is that given under the previous
word.

5. suaviter, ete: a polite but
distant reception oi the salute, es·
pecially is cupio, etc. (1 wish you
every success, 1¹m sure) only an ex·
pression oi thanks sor his interest.
-ut nunc est, ae. as the times go.

6. adsectentur, followed me up,
as Horace proceeds on his way.—
numquid vis: the regular formula
ol' leave-taking, 'l'here's nothing!
can dofhr you, tathaei-occupo,
Ι anta'cipute tim aoa'th.

¹7. noris nos, yes, make noys oc-
quaineance. It was not uncom·
mon to reply to this formula in a
sense contrary to its meaning, with
a kind ol pleasantry, as, l'es, take
core of yoursels: but here the anob
will not be turned off, and so rudely ·
tells the object olbis address. ·'1⁴he
,verb properly depends on vis.—
docti, an accomplr'shed artist, ἐκ.
a trained literary mananti diner
out, ct'. v. 22.-pluris, etc: like
0 indeed! Istat! think virore of
you, l’m sure, a cool reply.
