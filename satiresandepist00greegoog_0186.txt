'Ilm Epistles belong, as well as the Satires, to Horace’s
Musa pedestris. They are, like them, conversational moral or
literary essays‘ (Sermones‚· cf. ΙΙ. r. 250), of which the topics Ι

the person addressed aud afterwards copied by his permission.

they belong to the latter part of the poet’s life (see 1. 3 ; 1. ao),
about ae. ao-ra, later than any other of his works‚ except some
