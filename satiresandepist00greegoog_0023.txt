abortive comedy.. Ὗ

The model of Lucilius was exactly followed by Horace, and
the result is these two books of Satires, which for genial humor
and amusing representation of the vices and follies of mankind,

of human nature and social life that they show, and ibe felicity
of expression that abounds' on every page, they have always
been among the most admired and most quoted works of
ancient literature. ι = ⁸ ··

The style is always easy and gracefu15 never forced nor
affected. They must have been written at a dash, however
much Horace may have trimmed them and liled thern alier-
wards. They are never labored, notwithstanding the care with
which they must have been written, and if an idea attributed to
Horace is far-fetched we may be almost sure it is wrong and
not Horatian. The difficulties often found in following the
thought are not caused, as in some authors, bya labored ob·
scurity. They are the natural consequence of a quick seizing
and setting forth of salient points to an audience that could
readily supply the missing links.

The peculiar characteristic of Horace is his genial humor.
He does not inveigh against· the vices of mankind, but sets
forth the laughable aspects of their vices, and constantly in-
cludes himself among thev objects of his satire, being in this

respect more like Thackeray than any other author before or

srnce. ·

mon life, though they had become antiquated or had never
appeared in literature.
