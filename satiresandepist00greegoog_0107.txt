82. Valgius, C. Valgius Rufus,
an elegiae and epigrammatic poeta
friend of Horace, to whorn Od. 11.
9 is addressed. His writings are
now lost—OctavIus, a poet and
historiari. Virgil(?) speaks of him,
f'ntnlecta xlv,—

“Scri tequidem tua nos multum nrira·
Rapturrflffflilhiddnam flebimus historiam·

83. Fuscus: see I. 9. 61, od. I.
22, Ep. 1. 10. He was probably
only a literary connoisseur‚ as no
works of hisare known to us.-
Viscorum, one of them is men·
tioned in 1. 9. 22, but they are
otherwise unknown.

84. ambitione: as the others
were of high rank in prominent
positione, he mightbeaccuscd of am·

itious designa in mentioning them ;
therefore he declares that hc has no
such designa, and implies that their
prominence is so great that he can
mention thern without suspicion.

85. Pollior see v. 42.—Mes-
salla: see v. 29·- fratre, Pedius.

86. Bibule, Servi, Furni: oth·
erwise unknown-his: datIve fol-
lowing simul by an imitation of
the Greek ἅμα and un extension of
words of uearness and likeness.

87. doctos, connaisseurs,· cf. v
52 and 1. 9. 7.

88. prudens, purposely,· cf. inr-
prudens.—haec, the Satires, to
which this one is a kind of envoi.-
qualiacumque‚ such as they are.

89. arridere, gine pleasure, a
meaning transferred from its proper
meaning of smile upon. Cf. Cic. ad
Art. XIII. 21. 3.- doliturus: afa·
vorite construction with Horace, but
better rendered in English by and
I should, etc. ,

9ο. deterius, being applied toa
good thing, is equivalent to mInus,
and is very likely colloquial.

9¹· discipularum: by this word
Horace scoffs at these poets as
effeminate women’s darlings.— iu·
beo: the regular word, like our bid,
here with a kind of double meaning.
-plorare‚ rohiae, referring to the
love-sick songs that these meu sang
(and perhaps taught also), to the de·
lightofwomen,andalsototheGreek
οἰμώζειν Sthe opposite of χαίρειν).
The whoe ony amounts to, “1
leave you to whine among your pet·
tIcoated pupils, bad luck to'youJ'
3· 333333 333333733
quick and go.”-libellos the first
book of Satires.
