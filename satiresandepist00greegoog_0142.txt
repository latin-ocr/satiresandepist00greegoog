111.261-295.] HORATI SERMONES

Libertinus erat, qui circum compita siccus
lautis mane senex manibus currebat et ‘Vnum’
(⁴ Quid tam magnum?’ addens), ‘unum me surpite morti,
dis etenim facile est l' orabat3 sanus utrisque
auribus atque oculis; mentem, nisi litigiosus, sss
exciperet dominus cum venderet. Hoc quoque volgus
Chrysippus ponit fecunda in gente Meneni.
‘Iuppiter, ingentis qui das adimisque dolores,’

in Tiberi stabit.’ Casus medicusve levarit
aegrum ex praecipiti: mater delira necabit
in gelida fixum ripa febrimque reducet,
quone malo mentem concussa? Timore deorum. 295
